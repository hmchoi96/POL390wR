```

## Installation and Getting Started

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
install.packages('shiny')
library(shiny)
runExample("01_hello")



```

```{r newchunkname}
#define UI

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  titlePanel("titlePanel"),
  ## shiny generally follow javascript
  sidebarLayout( position = "left",
    sidebarPanel("sidebarPanel"),
    mainPanel(
      h1("First level title"),
      h2("Second level title"),
      h6("Sixth level title", align = "center"),
      
      p("p creates a paragraph of text. Supply a style attribute
        to change the format of the entire paragraph,", style = "font-family: 'times'; font-si16pt"),
      strong("strong() makes bold text."),
      em("em() creates italicized text."),
      br(),
      code("code displays your text similar to computer code"),
      div("div creates segments of text with a similar style. This division of text is all blue because I passed the argument 'syle = color:blue' to div", style = "color:blue",
          br(),
          em("div can do this too")
          ),
      p("span does the same thing as div, but it works with",
        span("groups of words", style = "color:red"),
        "that appear inside a paragraph"),
      img(src = "bird1.jpg", height = 72, width = 72)
    )
)
)
#define server logic
server <- function(input, output) {
  
}
#run the app
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

```{r layout}
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("titlePanel"),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel("sidebarPanel"),
    mainPanel("mainPanel")
  )
)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
